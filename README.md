I am currently getting all the files for the projec tin one place, a thing to not for the arduino is that there is no default QMC5883L library you need to install the zip file from dthain/QMC5883L repo then manually install it, also to configure the CT6B you need the install the relevant drivers from Silicon Digital labs after which you can install the T6config.exe note that you may need to rename the chinese folder or telugu folder if you r computer cannot find the file or directory.
